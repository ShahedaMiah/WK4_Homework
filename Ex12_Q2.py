tup = 'Hello'
print(len(tup))
# output is '5' because it is counting the length/number of characters in the 'tup' variable

tup1 = 'Hello',
print(len(tup1))
# output is '1' because there is a comma after 'Hello', which changes the string to a tuple. There is only 1 index in the tuple, so 1 is printed
